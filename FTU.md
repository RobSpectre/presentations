# Synthesia

## Worked

* Free
* Fast (for video)
* Feature rich - you can do a lot here
* Ability to share!
* 

## !Worked

* Quality variable for each actor - maybe lead with the best one?
* Need to be able to copy link
* Does anyone embed?
* Not *quite* frictionless - still got to give up lead info. Better than
  acccount signup, but still a hoop to jump through.

## Ideas

* Lower speed of video delivery
* Reduce option paralysis - be progressive with customization
* Limited free tier - can't hit me with the credit card that soon


# UIzard

## Worked

* Free

## !Worked

* Not frictionless
* FTU not five minutes 
* What is Capterra? Why does that matter?
* "Work email" - c'mon now
* Terms and Conditions? c'mon now
* Lead qual screen?
* Share before you've even used the thing?
* 6-10 clicks before you see anything?
* Option paralysis - way too many templates
* Blocked on AutoDesigner - already had two asks from me with nothign in return


# TVision

## Worked

* Don't know anything about the industry, but ad attention as a metric is novel

## !Worked

* Conversation before really seeing anything.
* Not free, frictionless or five minutes
* Left with more questions than answers with this website

## Ideas

* Webcam implementation of ad attention


# Ezra

## Worked

* "How It Works" asset is useful - found myself wanting it to autoplay without
  scroll
* Early detection stat is big - def want it earlier
* Design is clean - CTAs are clear and definite

## !Worked

* Front page assumes prior brand ID.
* Feels like bounce is probably very high.
* No Fs - obv with medical data no one is uploading their CT scan to get back a
  demo, but there is a way to get more F in here.

## Ideas

* Checkbox / vis comps to just getting a scan from primary
* Different landing page based on referrer / keyword
* Need testimonials in top nav
* Feels like what you're selling is full command of your cancer risk - feels
  like messaging should be more about ownership


# Voyant

## Worked

* Tech differentiators are robust 
* Quarter size comparison is good - find myself wanting a render of it mounted in bumper /
  grill / arm.

## !Worked

* Even with a highly specialized niche audience, more preference can be driven
  here. Needs checkbox comps, graph comps, side-by-side viz.
* For early stage, we're trying to drive brand ID for later consumption. Brand
  needs to move forward.
* Lead walled specs prob aren't helping.
* No Fs

## Ideas

* Bench / lab video would be welcome here a la Boston Dynamics. Their very
  early stuff didn't sizzle like what they put out now, but for in-market
  professionals it created a lot of industry buzz.
* Really want to see a visualization of performance at range and on dark
  targets.


# Clarifai

## Worked

## !Worked

## Ideas

* Every subject line in email needs reviewed.


# Headroom

## Worked

* Tour experience showing the transcription is compelling
* Couple routes to get into the product - both signup and account creation 
* Free
* Five minutes

## !Worked

* Not frictionless
* Video on front page is an IRL meeting? 
* Headline and copy undersells how transformative the app is
* Find myself wanting more guide 


## Ideas

* Is there a way to demo the meeting experience pre-signup? See the experience
  with your webcam and camera briefly without having to go through account
  creation.
* Would love another party in the meeting - maybe a tasteful explainer?


# Cionic

## Worked

* Free
* Videography is strong - I want to see Darryl's first dance with his daughter
* Larger subtitles

## !Worked

* Not frictionless
* Not five minutes
* Front page is more tell, don't show
* Clinical evidence is not prominent enough
* Blog need wayyyy more preview text

## Ideas

* Obv this is a complex domain. 3 Fs are going to need a loooot of creativity.
* Need more Jim videos - feels like you need a 30, 90, and 120 spot
* Front page should be silent super cut of the testominial videos
* A FTU could be an illustrated JS demo of how it works with interactive pathing for different
  conditions


# Norbert Health

## Worked

* Killer physician testimonials - these are great gets
* Sizzle reel is great - needs to be available without click
* Device looks good
* Fast - lead response was quick!

## !Worked

* Not free
* Not frictionless
* No easy share
* Get off medium - they are gobbling your Google juice
* Sizzle reel maybe serves too many masters - does company location matter for the consumer? Am I meeting Norbert the product or Norbert the company?
* Integrate stripe on page.

## Ideas

* Obv early days - need video showing how it working autoplay with no audio. 
* I want to see some of the app experience both from the POV of patient and
  physician 
* FTU I could imagine is illustrating the insight for common patient conditions
  that the user can select and see


# Gardin

## Worked

* Device looks great.
* Leading with yield is strong
* Strong intro video


## !Worked

* No Fs.
* News and Blog (not "Blogs") needs more preview text and photos
* Intro Video should be top 


## Ideas

* Obv pre-market product - think scope needs to be shifted from contact leads
  to brand ID. "Gardin" needs to be baked all over the page. 
* Is anything keeping you from taking pre-order reservations? Even for $50?


# Gryps

## Worked

* Value prop extremely clear - prob clearest in the portfolio
* Big name testimonials for New York - great gets

## !Worked

* No Fs
* Lead form needs multiselect box for the systems - picking multiple only
  selects one, wasting the user's time
* Screenshots are way too small - can't see what's up
* Need to shoot some testimonials for sizzle reel


## Ideas

* Good FTU would be a JS demo where user picks out two or three of the
  integrations and then is revealed what some combined data view would be for
  the user
* I feel like "glue" is a metaphor that could be masterfully paired with the
  brand Gryps


# Earkick

## Worked

* Free
* Frictionless
* <Five minutes

## !Worked

* Need a CTA after the test that is not just submitting feedback.
* Blog needs illustration


## Ideas

# Aquifer

## Worked

* Auto scheduling for demo
* Some footage of the product

## !Worked

* Not accepting free email is funnel constricting

# Glass

## Worked

* Good product shot 

## !Worked

* No Fs
* Text is so tiny
* No photography?

## Ideas

# Memorable

## Worked

* Show, don't tell
* Free
* Showing the previous generations is killer

## !Worked

* Not frictionless
* Not five minutes - experience is bugged. Generation never worked
* Forcing social sign-in

## Ideas

* Move ad maker to front page, lose the signin


# ImVitro

## Worked

* Sizzle reel is good - well illustrated


## !Worked

* Sizzle reel is not well branded. Brand ID important for this phase of
  company. 
* Contact form broken

## Ideas

* Embryo selector - a JavaScript quiz-like where the user picks the most likely
  to succeed ovule out of a set of five. Highlight four or five attributes that
  make a ovule unlikely to succeed. You have a good start to this in the case
  study


# Sea Machines

## Worked

* Explainer video for SM300 is really good.
* Case studies are robust

## !Worked

* No Fs - Whitepaper never came

## Ideas

* Point computer vision software at live webcam of a highly trafficked port


# Camio

## Worked

* Video of the product working on front page is great esp tailgating
* Free - was able to get VM running and connected to camera


## !Worked

* Not five minutes
* Not frictionless - would prefer a Docker image than a VM. This took a lot of
  work.
* VM is from 2020? Very old version of software I imagine.

## Ideas

* Live occupancy sensing of a stream of Times Square


# Daimon

## Worked

* Ethics statement prominent

# !Worked

* No Fs
* No acknowledgment email

## Ideas

* Exchange limited conversation on front page
